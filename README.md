# Coral Health Identification Model
a Convolutional Neural Network model to help monitoring coral reef health based on the bleaching color, referenced from Coral Health Chart.

## Architecture
DenseNet169

## Library
Main:
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Model

This Thesis Project Produced 2 Models for coral health monitoring:
1. Coral Reef Type Classifier
2. Coral Reef Colour Classifier

This is due to Coral Health Chart which limit the types and colors of coral that can be monitored.

## Dataset
Collected from various source in the internet and taken by myself in Indonesia water.
